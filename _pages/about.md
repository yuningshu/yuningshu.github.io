Hi! I'm currently a second-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Mathematics and Statistics.

I'm interested in statistics and machine learning. Particularly, I'm interested in the methods that can be applied to complex biological and health-related data, such as clinical trials and genomics.

Feel free to contact me through [first][last]@uchicago.edu!
