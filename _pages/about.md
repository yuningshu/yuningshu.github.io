Hi! My name is Yuning Shu, and I'm currently a 2nd-year undergraduate student at UChicago majoring in Statistics.

I'm interested in statistical methods and machine learning techniques that can be applied to complex data in biological and health-related fields, such as clinical trials and genomics.
